Using DisplayLink screens with Ubuntu/Zenbook
=============================================

This is still incomplete work, as it's somewhat working with Unity but not with MATE.

This script is based on the [ArchLinux displaylink script](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DisplayLink/displaylink.sh),
and additional instructions were found at [its wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DisplayLink).
