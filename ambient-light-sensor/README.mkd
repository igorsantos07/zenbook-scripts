Helper script to enable/disable ambient light sensor
====================================================

This was found somewhere and adapted to create better notifications.
Sorry for not quoting the original author, I can't find where I saw that :(

I added an `install.sh` script so it runs everything it needs to install the
driver and controller, instead of muggling with the two folder's readmes.
You might need to tweak the folders inside the script since I just created what
fits my setup :)
